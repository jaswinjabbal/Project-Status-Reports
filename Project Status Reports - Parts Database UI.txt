* This week I worked on setting up a desirable framework  for creating web applications through python, with Flask.
* I was able to see “Hello World” running on my local server, at a specified HTML page.
* For next week, I hope to establish a connection to MySQL from python and add button functionality as its own HTML file + continue video series (2/16)
