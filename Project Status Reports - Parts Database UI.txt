* This week I worked on setting up a desirable framework  for creating web applications through python, with Flask.
* I was able to see “Hello World” running on my local server, at a specified HTML page.
* For next week, I hope to establish a connection to MySQL from python and add button functionality as its own HTML file + continue video series (2/16)

* This week I was researching possible code languages and IDEs.
* I tried Xcode and Swift but could not get the most updated version on my MAC.
* To solve this I had to move to a cross platform option such as using Java as the backend and flutter flow as the front end.

* This week I established a connection between a local Mysql database and my java backend code.
* By the end of the week I am hoping to create an api call from my frontend on flutter flow to my java backend code.
* In the upcoming week I want to start developing for the introduction (Hello World), project.
* This will entail getting my apple developer account started.
