Project Status Reports - Parts Database UI


“... provide your TA with a simple written progress report of your personal activity for a given week.  This report should include issues you are struggling with, newly discovered problems, and what solutions you are taking to overcome them.  Describe the short-term milestones you are tracking.”


Week | 9/10 - 9/16
-------------------
Student | Jaswin Jabbal
* This week I worked on setting up a desirable framework  for creating web applications through python, with Flask.
* I was able to see “Hello World” running on my local server, at a specified HTML page.
* For next week, I hope to establish a connection to MySQL from python and add button functionality as its own HTML file + continue video series (2/16)

Student | Jamaal Bloom
* This week I worked connecting the digikey api into my python code. 
* Next week I hope to be able to read and write data from the mysql data in python. 
* A current problem I am facing is that I have to manually input the auth code for the api

Student | Tony Beneventi
* This week I was researching possible code languages and IDEs.
* I tried Xcode and Swift but could not get the most updated version on my MAC.
* To solve this I had to move to a cross platform option such as using Java as the backend and flutter flow as the front end.


Week | 9/17 - 9/23
-------------------
Student | Jaswin Jabbal
* This week I established the connection to Dr. Lusher's database through the mysql-connector for python. 
* Additionally, I explored the possbility for using streamlit.io for UI demonstrations, with its ease of use for DB operations.
* In the coming weeks, I will work on integrating UI widget capabilties to the WIP streamlit demo web application.

Student | Jamaal Bloom
* This week I used the refresh token to replace the auth code to gather the access code
* I also began reading the database. I noticed that some parts in the database is incorrect. I hope to resolved these errors in the upcoming weeks.

Student | Tony Beneventi
* This week I established a connection between a local Mysql database and my java backend code.
* By the end of the week I am hoping to create an api call from my frontend on flutter flow to my java backend code.
* In the upcoming week I want to start developing for the introduction (Hello World), project.
* This will entail getting my apple developer account started.


Week | 9/24 - 9/30
-------------------
Student | Jaswin Jabbal
* This week I collaborated on the FSR, ICD, and led the Execution Plan, as well as our midterm presentation.
* This week I did not update the code itself much; rather I was engaged in tutorials for streamlit and Flask designs.
* Next week, I will study what it may take to replicate a streamlit page in Flask.

Student | Jamaal Bloom
* This week I managed to iterate through the database in order to collect all the wrong part numbers.
* There a many different types of errors for the part numbers so each error will need to be resolved one by one.

Student | Tony Beneventi
* This week I started developing a connection from flutter flow to my backend in java
* I was able to work on my introduction project and create a RESTAPI Call using spring-boot and a local ngrok web server
* By adding a button to my flutter flow, I am able to click the button and have it count every time it calls the hello world
